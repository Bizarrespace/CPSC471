# Final exam concepts
* 15 MCQ 7-10 Short
  * 8 pages cheat sheet
* Chapter 4: Data plane
  * Forwarding vs routing:
    * Local, data plane stuff like that
  * Gerneal forwarding based on ehader field, network layer, transport layer or data link layer
    * VS destiniation based forwarding
  * Series of packest, should be able to list based on mechnaicms, like round robin, should be able to list
    * Practice quiz
  * Subnet part and host port
    * identifying each
    * 2^8 = 256 useable?
    * 10,1,0,1 /24 network
    * 8 8 8 (subnet part all three 8s) 8 (host)

* Chapter 5: Control plane
  * Link state(centralized) vs distance vector
    * Which algo, Link dji, distance bford, distance only info about itself and neighbor
  * NO DIJI ALGO WORKS
  * NO COMPLEXITY OF ALGO
  * Distance vector algo:
    * Each node, what happens
  * Intra as vs inter AS
  * OSPF
  * BGP Important, only routing protocol for inter AS, glue that holds internet together
  * AS-PATH meaning
  * BGP Polcy based, rules over performance
  * Hot potato routing, how works
    * Why chose a node vs another
  * SDN, controler, openflow(protocol bteween contorler and devices)
    * Enables comm., defines format
  * NO ARTICUTURE OF OPDENDAYLIGHT
    * just know what it is, liek widely used controler
  * ICMP
    * Net comm. error reproting, reachabiltiy information

* Chapter 6
  * Partiy checking
    * Issue with example, first column wrong
  * Cyclic Redundancy ccheck
    * Error detection coding, mechanims
    * NO CALC CRC
  * Mac protocol:
    * Channel(The three), random access(CSMA CD), taking turns
    * CSMA what number uses it something .11, 802.3 how that relates to CMSA CD and other algo
  * Data link uses MAC address
  * ARP
    * Mapping from IP to
  * Routing
    * Whats the source and destinatinon mac address, should be able tot tell, in quiz
  * Etneret uses MAC address
  * Diff btwee swtiches and routers
    * What layers are each
  * VLANs
    * What does it help you make
  * MPLS capable routers
    * Flexibilty something about labeling
      
* Chapter 7:
  * Wireless link charactersistc
    * Physical layer
    * SNR same, dif phyical layer to have higher throughput, understand statement
    * Phy changes, increase SNR something incdrease
  * Def of CDMA
    * Same freq, encoding and ecoding
  * 802.11 channels, association
    * access poi;nt, beacon frames, select AP to associate
    * Arriving host: how this works
    * NO MME
    * Name of beacon frames, and selecting sync signal, then authenticate, and then configer soehting plane
    * NO PASSIVE AND ACTICE
    * Uses CSMA/CA
      * Describe it, draw diagram, explain it
      * slide 26
    * RTS-CTS concept
    * Given the frame, can tell which is wireless or ethernet, their frames, 28, should know differences
  * Dif btw 4G and 5G
    * No backward compatitble
    * 10x bitrate, 10x decrease lateency,
    * 4G longer range
  * Tunneling
    * Base stateion and PGW
  * Base station assoication
    * How it works, 47
  * Mobility:
    * Let end systesm handle it in edge
  * Direct routing adv vs indirect routing
  * 4G major mobity
    * BS assocation 65
    * 4 main, task for 4G mobiltiy
  * BS hand over 68-69
    * KNow the process
    * 


   * Each layer resopnsiabilties, one senetence for each layer, functionality of each layer
