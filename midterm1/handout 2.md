# Handout 2
1) How does the digital subscriber line allow telephy and internet to co-exist on the same link?
  * using different frequencies for data nd voice transmission.
2) What is the function of DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM)?
  * To separate voice and data signals at the central office
  * Data sigs to internet and voice sigs to telephone network
3) What is the main limiation of DSL?
  * As the distance between the user's location and the central office goes up, the signal quality is decreased, resulting in lower data transmission rates
4) Explain structure and function of hybrid fiber coat(HFC) approach to connecting residences on the internet. How does it differ from DSL? What are the advantages? Are there security concerns?
  * Connects residences to internet using combo of fiber-optic and coaxial cables. Uses FDM instead to transmit data an dTV sigs at different freq over shared cable.
  * Higher speeds compared to DSL, but there are secuirty concerns because of the fact that it has to use a shared access network
5) Difference between guided and unguided media?
  * Guided: sigs through solid media like copper, fiber, coax
  * Unguided: Sigs freely through air like radio
6) A B connected through two intervening routers. All links have speeds of 10 bps.
  * A --10bps-->Router---10bps-->Router--10bps-->B
  * A) 10000 / 10 = 1000 seconds
  * B) 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000 seconds
7) Why is store-and-forward approach necessary?
