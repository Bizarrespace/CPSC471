# Plan of attack
* Do all quizzes~~
* After done with the questions and you understand well
  * Add the quiz questions into cheatsheet, ones that are hard to remember/difficult to understand 
  * Skim the slides, and add stuff that are important onto the cheat sheet, that were not covered by the quizzes

# Final Review sheet
* Should look like all the quizzes combined, plus some extra information that you think are going to be tested

# Done with study once
* Completed cheatsheet, redo all quizzes, and then skim through information that you put on cheatsheet
