# Handout 5
* Describe the function of each layer of the TCP/IP model:
  * <u>Application Layer</u>: Support network applications like HTTP
  * <ins>Transport Layer</ins>: Manages process-to-process data transfer, using protocols like TCP and UDP
  * <ins>Network Layer</ins>: Handles routing of datagrams from source to destination, using IP and routing protocols
  * <ins>Link Layer</ins>: Manages data transfer between neighboring network elements, using tech like WiFi or Ethernet
  * <ins>Physical Layer</ins>: Deals with the transmission of bits "on the wire", so dealing with things such as converting digital data into signals that can be transmitted over the physical medium
